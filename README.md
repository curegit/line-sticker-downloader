# Line Sticker Downloader

Download images and assets from LINE Store

Those resources are located in public web directories, so anyone can get them easily and legally (Private use only)

## Requirements

- PHP7 (CGI)
  - Zip

debian example
`sudo apt install php-cli php-zip`

## Install

Download zip and extract it to any web directory (Personal server recommended)

## Usage

1. Go to index.php
2. Fill ID
3. Click "Download" button
4. Wait
5. Click "Download" link

### Note

The document size of a download page would be large because the PHP program outputs a lot of dummy data so that a server sends document data continuously and a browser refresh the screen.
