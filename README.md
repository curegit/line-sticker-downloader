See url of the store page.

### IDs are consecutive

- Official stickers are from 1
- Creator's stickers are from 1000000

### Download multiple sticker packages

Use CLI with loop command.

`for ((i=1000; i<=1050; i++)); do php download.php $i; done`

## Notes

- The document size of download page would be large because the PHP program outputs a lot of dummy data so that a server sends document data continuously and a browser refresh the screen.
- Sticker resources are located in public web directories, so anyone can get them easily and legally (private use only).
